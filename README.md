# Automated-Analysis-of-News-Headlines-Using-Web-Scraping-and-AI
This project automates the collection, classification, and analysis of news headlines from multiple Chilean media outlets. Using Selenium-based web scraping, the system extracts real-time headlines from major news websites and processes them with an AI language model to classify each headline into predefined thematic categories such as Politics, Economy, International, Sports, Security, and Entertainment.

The classified data is then structured into JSON format and transformed into analytical datasets using Pandas. To uncover editorial focus and agenda patterns across media outlets, the project applies per-source normalization and visualizes the results through proportional heatmaps, enabling clear comparison between news categories regardless of outlet size or publishing volume.

This pipeline demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow combining web automation, natural language processing, data engineering, and data visualization, and can be extended to study media bias, agenda setting, or temporal trends in news coverage.

What I Learned

I learned how to build an end-to-end data pipeline that combines web scraping, AI-based text classification, and data visualization. I gained experience extracting and cleaning unstructured data with Selenium, structuring AI outputs into usable datasets, and applying normalization techniques to create meaningful comparisons across news sources. This project strengthened my skills in NLP, data analysis, and visual storytelling.
